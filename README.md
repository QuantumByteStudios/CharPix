Project Description

This Python script reads binary data from a text file, converts it to an image, and displays/saves the image. It includes functions to obtain binary representation from ASCII text, calculate optimal image dimensions, and handle pixel writing based on the binary data. The script utilizes the PIL (Python Imaging Library) module for image creation and processing. The resulting image is displayed and saved as "image.png."
